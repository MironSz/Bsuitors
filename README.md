# Bsuitors
Project was done  as a part of Concurrent Programming Class at University of Warsaw.

Parrarel implementation of b-sutoirs algorithm based on https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apothen/Papers/bMatching-SISC-2016.pdf

Sory for ugly code and commit messages :)

This implentation is noticably faster than required. It also uses few non-obvious optimizations of my own idea.
